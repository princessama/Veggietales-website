          How we started!
        </h1>
        <p class="text-green">
          VeggieTales is created, written, and produced by Big Idea Productions.
          In an age of media mega-mergers, Big Idea is a small, independent,
          family entertainment company based in Chicago. We hope to help parents
          everywhere by building a company filled with storytellers and artists
          who are committed to using their gifts and talents to teach kids
          timeless values like honesty, kindness, and forgiveness.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="text-green">
          Go to Big IdeaThe company began in 1993 when Phil Vischer started
          creating the first VeggieTales video in a spare bedroom. With no money
          and no connections, Phil had almost nothing except a computer and one
          very BIG idea: that children's entertainment could do more than sell
          toys - it could positively impact lives.

          Larry the Cucumber
        </h2>

        <p class="text-purple text-center w-80">
          Larry is cheerful, kind, creative, energetic, accident-prone, moral
          and goofy. At times he is leader-like. He is in some ways quite the
          opposite of his alter-ego LarryBoy. As LarryBoy, he is tough, brave
          and serious.

          Bob the Tomato
        </h2>
        <p class="text-purple text-center w-80">
          Bob is a friendly but often stressed tomato. He acts as the straight
          man of the hosts. He is always willing to teach children how to be
          kind. He can easily be annoyed, especially by his best friend Larry
          the Cucumber, and is irritated if he is not in control. In addition to
          this he becomes unamused when his show is not going according to his
          plan. Despite that, though, he is still a lovable and pleasant tomato.

          Junior Asparagus
        </h2>
        <p class="text-purple text-center w-80">
          Junior can be described as curious, courteous, and naive. He’s always
          eager to try new things and learn something along the way. Junior
          ultimately functions as the surrogate child to any children watching
          the show(s). Like most kids, Junior faces many challenges that are
          crucial to a child’s mental and emotional development, like learning
          how to forgive, dealing with bullies, and learning how to treat others
          with love and respect. Nevertheless, he’s a fun, caring and lovable
          kid.

          Laura Carrot
        </h2>
        <p class="text-purple text-center w-80">
          Laura is sweet, outgoing, and fairly courteous. She always tries to be
          the voice of reason, often trying to prove a point to her friends.
          While her friend Junior is more ambitious, Laura is generally more
          cautious. However, Laura isn’t afraid to get herself or others into a
          little mischief every now and again.

          Archibald Asparagus
        </h2>
        <p class="text-purple text-center w-80">
          He is usually depicted as snooty, intolerable of nonsense, funny, or
          royal. He often plays as kings, geniuses, and authority figures. He is
          quite eccentric, to say the least. He often uses complex vocabulary,
          which often confuses some of the other veggies. He has shown
          intolerance for Silly Songs in earlier shows, but as years have gone
          by, he loosened up and even performed in his own silly songs.

          Pa Grape
        </h2>
        <p class="text-purple text-center w-80">
          Pa Grape is very wise and down-to-earth, often being a source of good
          advice to his friends and peers. He enjoys helping his friends and
          encouraging them to do what is right. In contrast, Pa isn’t afraid to
          have fun and be silly, which can make him look rather odd in the eyes
          of his peers. But at the end of the day, Pa is someone the VeggieTales
          crew can always rely on and trust through and through.

          Jimmy and Jerry
        </h2>
        <p class="text-purple text-center w-80">
          Bob and Larry are like Abbot and Costello, Jimmy and Jerry are like
          Tweedledee and Tweedledum. They like eating and singing a lot. They
          don’t do a whole lot, but they do like helping others when they’re
          needed. Jimmy is considered to be the more brash and talkative one. It
          has also been shown that he has a short temper. Jerry is quieter and
          arguably slightly more intelligent than his brother. He is often shown
          repeating some phrases from his brother.

        </h2>
        <p class="text-purple text-center w-80">
          Petunia Rhubarb is very sweet and loves to remind others that true
          beauty isn’t based on what someone looks like on the outside, but who
          someone is on the inside that matters most.
